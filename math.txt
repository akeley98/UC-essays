It's truly unfortunate how many think of mathematics solely as a
mechanical task, a lowly tool useful only for scientists and
engineers. Mathematics is undeniably practical, but this fact should
not distract us from seeing that at its core, mathematics is an art
form as creatively expressive as any other. Central to any art form
are choice and emotion; without choice, the author cannot show
creativity; without emotion, the audience will not recognize it as
art. A mathematician uses both when constructing a proof, although
many may not realize it, viewing mathematicians as cartographers
merely discovering and recording preexisting steps and
conclusions. True, reality imposes constraints on proofs, in the sense
that one cannot choose to prove a false conclusion, but the steps a
proof comprises are an original creation, the product of the author's
numerous artistic choices.

Consider, for example, two proofs regarding a triangle inscribed in a
circle, where one edge of the triangle is the circle's diameter. For
the first proof, we draw a radius dividing the angle opposite the
diameter into two angles A and B, forming two sub-triangles. Having
two radii as identical edges, the sub-triangles are isosceles, each
having two equal angles A or B at the circle's edge. Thus, the
original triangle has angles A, B, and A+B (the divided angle). Their
sum, 2A+2B, must equal 180 degrees. Algebraically, the A+B angle
equals half that, 90 degrees, proving the original triangle is a right
triangle. For the second proof, we rotate a copy of the triangle 180
degrees about the center to form a parallelogram whose diagonals are
both diameters. This parallelogram is rectangular since its diagonals
are equal, so the original triangle contained within is a right
triangle. Both proofs lead to the same inevitable conclusion and are
equal logically; however, they are not equal artistically. The first
proof elicits a grudging acceptance that the conclusion is not false;
the second reveals an underlying pattern and illuminates with its
simplicity. I take pride in mathematics, my chosen art form, and I
strive to write proofs that are both artistic and logical.
