So, I'm taking Experimental Psychophysiology class in order to satisfy
my IGETC Biology requirement. Of course I could satisfy this
requirement by enrolling in Biology 101, but to be honest, I'd rather
minimize the amount of time I spend in generic requirement-satisfying
classes, which tend to be full of uninterested students being taught
by the instructor who drew the shortest straw. It's so much more fun
to spend time in an environment full of enthusiastic people, and I
feel that I've found this environment by opting for the Psychology
class instead.

Taking this class has also provided me with with more objective
benefits. The class tasks students with designing their own psychology
experiments and writing cited, APA-formatted papers comparable to
published research papers. In this sense, this class is one of the few
classes offered at the community college level that teaches both
science and scientific knowledge; most science classes focus
exclusively on the latter. Although I will ultimately be publishing
papers on a different topic, I'm glad to have experienced instruction
on writing research papers relatively early on in my academic career.

West Valley College has provided me with a great opportunity in
offering this Experimental Psychophysiology class both due to its
learning environment and the science and technical writing practice it
offers. I am glad to have taken advantage of this opportunity.
